##  Project Overview

This project aims to classify flower images into **10 distinct categories** based on subtle visual differences like petal shape, size, and color.  
The classification model is built using a **custom CNN based on ResNet architecture** and trained from scratch on the Kaggle flower dataset.

##  How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install torch torchvision tqdm
```

2. **Train the Model**

```bash
from interface import the_trainer, TheModel, the_dataloader

model = TheModel()
the_trainer(model, the_dataloader)
```

3. **Predict on New Images**

```bash
from interface import the_predictor

image_paths = ["data/img01.jpg", "data/img02.jpg", ...]  # List of image file paths
predictions = the_predictor(image_paths)
print(predictions)
```

##  Model Architecture

- **Base**: Custom Residual Network (ResNet-inspired)
- **Enhancements**:
  - Residual Connections to avoid vanishing gradients
  - Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks for channel-wise feature recalibration
  - Data augmentations to improve model generalization
  - Label smoothing in loss function to reduce overconfidence
  - Cosine annealing learning rate scheduler
- **Final classifier**: Fully Connected Layers with Dropout Regularization

---

## Training Strategy

- **Loss Function**: CrossEntropyLoss with label smoothing (`0.1`)
- **Optimizer**: AdamW (Adam optimizer with decoupled weight decay)
- **Scheduler**: CosineAnnealingLR
- **Early Stopping**: Patience of 10 epochs without improvement
- **Checkpointing**: Best model saved automatically

---

## Data Description

- Source: Kaggle Flower Classification Dataset  
- Input: Colored flower images (JPEG format)  
- Output: Classification label (1 out of 10 categories)

**Data Augmentations** (during training):
- Random resized crops
- Random horizontal & vertical flips
- Random affine transformations
- Random color jitter
- Random rotations

## Notes

- All code is modularized as per project submission guidelines.
- Hyperparameters and input sizes are stored in `config.py`.
- `interface.py` standardizes all imports for automatic grading.
